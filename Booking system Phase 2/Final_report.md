# Security Assessment Report

## **1. Introduction**

### **Purpose and Scope of the Report**
This updated report presents the latest security assessment conducted using **ZAP by Checkmarx**. The primary objective is to detect vulnerabilities and compare findings against the previous security scan.

### **Testing Schedule and Environment**
- **Environment:** Localhost (`http://localhost:8000`)
- **Testing Tool Used:** ZAP by Checkmarx

### **Scope of Testing**
The focus was on:
- **User-Agent Fuzzing Analysis**
- **Identifying security misconfigurations in API responses**
- **Verifying previous vulnerabilities were patched**

### **Methods and Tools Used**
- **Automated Security Scanning:** OWASP ZAP
- **Industry Standards:** OWASP Web Security Testing Guide ([WSTG](https://owasp.org/wstg))

## **2. Summary**

### **Key Findings and Recommendations**
1. **No Critical, Medium, or Low-Risk Vulnerabilities Found**  
   - The system does not exhibit major security weaknesses.
  
2. **User-Agent-Based Response Variance Identified**  
   - The system responds differently to multiple User-Agent headers, but no security risks were found.

3. **Recommendation:**  
   - While no immediate critical action is needed, **ensure uniform request handling** for all User-Agent values.

### **General Assessment of Security Posture**
- The **security posture has improved** significantly.
- **No high or medium-risk vulnerabilities** remain.
- **Only informational-level alerts** were detected.

## **3. Findings and Categorization**

### **Identified Deviations and Vulnerabilities**
| **Risk Level** | **Number of Alerts** |
|--------------|----------------|
| High        | 0              |
| Medium      | 0              |
| Low         | 0              |
| Informational | 1             |

---

### **Informational Alerts**
#### **User Agent Fuzzer**
- **Risk Level:** Informational
- **Number of Instances:** 12
- **Description:** Differences in response based on the User-Agent header.
- **Example Attacks Tested:**
  - `Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)`
  - `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko`
  - `Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 8_0_2 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/600.1.4`
  - `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)`

- **Potential Issue:** If the application behaves differently based on User-Agent, attackers could exploit this for reconnaissance or bypass access controls.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure all User-Agent variations receive consistent responses unless required for functionality.

# **4. Comparison with Previous Report**

This section provides a **direct comparison** between the **previous security assessment (Part 1)** and the **updated security assessment (Part 2)** to highlight the differences in findings and overall security posture.

## **Key Differences Between Part 1 & Part 2**
| **Category** | **Previous Report (Part 1)** | **Updated Report (Part 2)** |
|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Testing Date** | 19.02.2025 | 05.03.2025 |
| **High-Risk Vulnerabilities** | Found (**Path Traversal**) | **None** |
| **Medium-Risk Vulnerabilities** | Found (**Missing Security Headers - CSP, X-Frame-Options**) | **None** |
| **Low-Risk Vulnerabilities** | Found (**X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing**) | **None** |
| **Informational Alerts** | **User-Agent Fuzzing (1 instance)** | **User-Agent Fuzzing (12 instances)** |
| **Overall Security Posture** | **Moderate (High & Medium risks present)** | **Secure (No high/medium risks found)** |

---

## **Findings Analysis**
1. **Significant Security Improvements:**  
   - High and medium-risk vulnerabilities **identified in the previous report** (e.g., **Path Traversal, Missing CSP, and X-Frame-Options**) are **no longer present** in the updated scan.
   - This indicates that **prior security recommendations were implemented**, strengthening the applicationâ€™s defense against attacks.

2. **Increase in Informational Alerts:**  
   - The **User-Agent Fuzzing** test now has **12 instances** compared to **1 instance in the previous scan**.
   - While this is **not a security vulnerability**, it indicates that the system **responds differently to multiple User-Agent values**. This should be investigated to ensure **consistent request handling**.

3. **Security Posture Upgrade:**  
   - The previous scan assessed the system as **moderate risk**, while the updated report classifies it as **secure**, as no high or medium-risk vulnerabilities were found.

# **Conclusion**
- The updated security assessment demonstrates **substantial improvements** in the system's security posture.
- **All previously identified critical and medium vulnerabilities have been addressed.**
- The **only remaining observation** is **User-Agent-based response variations**, which should be reviewed to ensure security consistency.

ðŸš€ **This report provides a clear comparison between the initial security findings and the current security status, highlighting major improvements.**
