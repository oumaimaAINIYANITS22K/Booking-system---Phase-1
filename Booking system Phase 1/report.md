# Security Assessment Report

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose and Scope of the Report
This report provides a security assessment of the web application using **ZAP by Checkmarx**. The objective is to identify, categorize, and address security vulnerabilities that pose risks to the system. The findings serve as a foundation for strengthening the security posture of the application.

### Testing Schedule and Environment
- **Test Conducted On:** 19.02.2025
- **Environment:** Localhost (http://localhost:8000)
- **Testing Tool Used:** ZAP by Checkmarx

### Scope of Testing
The security assessment covered:
- **Input validation vulnerabilities** (e.g., Path Traversal attacks)
- **Security header misconfigurations** (e.g., Missing CSP, X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options headers)
- **Potential attack surfaces** (e.g., User Agent Fuzzing)
- **Common web application vulnerabilities** based on OWASP guidelines

### Methods and Tools Used
- **Automated Security Scanning:** Conducted using **ZAP by Checkmarx**
- **Manual Review:** Analysis of identified vulnerabilities
- **Industry Standards:** References include **OWASP, CWE, and WASC guidelines**

## 2. Summary

### Key Findings and Recommendations
The security scan identified several vulnerabilities categorized into **High, Medium, and Low risk levels**. The critical issues requiring **immediate attention** include:

1. **Path Traversal (Critical - Red)** - Attackers can access unauthorized files outside the web root directory.
   - **Immediate Action:** Implement strict input validation, reject directory traversal characters, and use path canonicalization.

2. **Missing Security Headers (Medium - Yellow)** - Absence of **Content Security Policy (CSP)** and **X-Frame-Options** headers exposes the application to XSS and Clickjacking attacks.
   - **Immediate Action:** Configure web server to enforce CSP, X-Frame-Options, and other security headers.

3. **X-Content-Type-Options Missing (Low - Green)** - Allows MIME sniffing, increasing security risks.
   - **Immediate Action:** Set the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header for all responses.

### General Assessment of Security Posture
The **overall security posture** of the system is **moderate**, with critical vulnerabilities requiring urgent mitigation. Implementing security best practices, such as input validation, secure headers, and access control measures, will significantly enhance protection against common threats.

## 3. Findings and Categorization

### **Red (Critical) - High Risk Vulnerabilities**
| Name | Description | Affected Endpoint | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Path Traversal** | Allows unauthorized access to system files through crafted input. | `/register (POST, username parameter)` | Implement input validation, restrict directory traversal characters, and use path canonicalization functions. |

### **Yellow (Medium) - Moderate Risk Vulnerabilities**
| Name | Description | Affected Endpoint | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set** | Increases risk of XSS and data injection attacks. | `/register (GET)` | Configure web server to enforce a restrictive CSP header. |
| **Missing Anti-Clickjacking Header** | No protection against clickjacking attacks. | `/register (GET, X-Frame-Options parameter)` | Set `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or use CSPâ€™s `frame-ancestors` directive. |

### **Green (Low) - Minor Risk Vulnerabilities**
| Name | Description | Affected Endpoint | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing** | Allows MIME-sniffing, increasing security risks. | `/register (GET, POST), /static/styles.css (GET)` | Set the `X-Content-Type-Options` header to `nosniff`. |

### **Informational Findings**
| Name | Description | Affected Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **User Agent Fuzzer** | Observes response variations based on User-Agent modifications. | `/register (POST, Header User-Agent)` |

## Conclusion
Addressing the identified **high and medium-risk vulnerabilities** is crucial to improving the applicationâ€™s security. The **Path Traversal issue should be remediated immediately**, while missing security headers should be added to enhance protection against common threats. Regular security assessments, adherence to best practices, and continuous monitoring will help maintain a robust security posture.
